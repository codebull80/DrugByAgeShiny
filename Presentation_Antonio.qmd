## About this project

This project develop an interface to the 2012 data of National Survey on Drug Use and Health.It automatically downloads data from the fivethirtyeight github repository <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/drug-use-by-age/drug-use-by-age.csv>
Then it performs some manipulations to tidy the dataset.

Two categories are analysed:

-   "Percentage of those in an age group who used each substance in the past 12 months"

-   "Median number of times a user in an age group used each substance in the past 12 months"
